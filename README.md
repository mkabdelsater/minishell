# Running the Shell
- download the repo, run `make`, then `./minishell`

## Supported Featuers
- History
- Pipelines
- Redirection
- Subshells
- Wildcards.

# What we had to do
- Make a shell program with "minimal" features.
  
# What we actually had to do
- Write an interpreter for the unix shell language.

# Things I researched
- Memory Management patterns, specifically Memory Arenas/Static Allocators.
- Interpreters and Compilers.
  
# Lessons Learned
- Using Generative AI tools well is all about context management and specificity.
- Writing a good parser is about half the difficulty of this project => in a multilayered system (OS, programing language, game) the bottom layers need to have solid design to support the top layers.
- Project and Time management == task prioritization.
